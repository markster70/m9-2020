        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <p>In early 2019, we worked with Object Tech Limited, a BlockChain start-up business, in order to create a simple, but professional web presence.</p>
        <p>We created a single page, animated website, highlighting the key facets of ObjectTech's business proposition. The website used both images, and video to engage visitors to the site.</p>

        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>Using traditional Front-End languages - HTML / CSS / JavaScript, we were asked to deliver a website that could be used by the business owners to promote the company as they travelled internationally to explore new business opportunities for their BlockChain Technology.</p>
        <p>We achieved this in 5 working days, to meet the very tight timescales the owners were working towards, with their travel and business plans. The website was a successful instrument in attracting new business ot the company.</p>
