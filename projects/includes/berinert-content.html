        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <p>During Summer of 2020, I worked with Pegasus Public Relations to deliver a re-engineer of an application highlighting the properties of a medication.</p>
        <p>The aims for this project were two-fold - apply a completely new UI design for the application, and also make the application fully available offline,</p>
        <p>so that the representatives of the business are able to use the app in locations where network access can be difficult, such as hospitals.</p>

        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>The traditional front end languages are used here - 'Vanilla' Javascript, SCSS, HTML5, as well as the Service Worker, and Cache API's</p>
        <p>The UI re-design needed to be delivered exactly as the design team had specified, while swapping out the deprecated application cache, and replacing with</p>
        <p>a Service Worker approach, coupled with the use of the Cache API to ensure full application access at any time.</p>
        <p>The build tooling for the project was also very dated, with little documentation, so a re-build of that was undertaken, along with the addition of some clear directions for other developers to follow in future.</p>
        <p>The result - an up to date application, applying the great UI of the design team at Pegasus, with seamless offline operation, and an industry standard development environment for further content changes going forward.</p>
