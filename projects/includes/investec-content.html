        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <p>During early 2018, we worked with Investec Bank PLC to restructure their Client Communications Architecture.</p>
        <p>Originally, client emails and statements were being statically built, or created externally - the turnaround being at least 2-3 days, with little consideration for scale, design consistency, or code re-use.</p>
        <p>The objectives were to re-engineer both the templates, and the build processes for each mail-out, as well as coaching internal engineers on best practices for Front End Code.</p>

        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p> We worked to create a bespoke component / template based framework with HTML / SCSS, Node, Gulp, and Javascript that enabled the Comms Team to be able to produce new email and statement communications in a matter of 2-3 hours.</p>
        <p>By creating a series of re-usable components, email / statement boiler-plates, and an abstracted SCSS framework, the development and production processes were completely streamlined, and refined into a scalable build system, with a high level of re-use, and adaptability to corporate brand requirements.
        <p>We also engineered all of the new templates / boiler-plates to work across all devices, rather than just for 'desktop' based email client software.</p>
        <p>The internal developers were left with a clear architecture for future development with a pattern library, as we as much clearer vision on how to construct front-end code.</p>
