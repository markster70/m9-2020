            <h3>Objectives</h3>
            <p>In May 2020 we worked with a Sussex Beauty Boutique to create an online platform for them to market and sell their beauty products online.</p>
            <p>Using the Shopify platform, we created a bespoke theme for the company that delivered ecommerce capability within a week. The shop is fully responsive, and provides an excellent CMS for the business owners to be able to develop and enrich their sales capabilities.</p>

            <h3>Outcomes</h3>
            <p>Getting this shop online quickly was one of the key deliverables for this project. The business had been impacted by COVID-19, and needed to be able to trade online. We delivered a working shop in 7 days</p>
            <p>Being able to manage the inventory and marketing for the online platform was also very important for the business. We took advantage of Shopify's capabilities to deliver a bespoke theme with a CMS that is very usable for non technical personnel.</p>
