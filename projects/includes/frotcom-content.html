            <h3>Objectives</h3>
            <p>In early 2020, I was commissioned to create a custom Wordpress Theme for Frotcom Ireland, Ireland based Haulage Specialists</p>
            <p>The brief was to produce a semantic, seo compatible, CMS based website, that completely matched UI design specification, as well as making the UI patterns for navigating he key areas of the site perform well with a pleasing user experience.</p>

            <h3>Outcomes</h3>
            <p>The traditional front end languages are used here - 'Vanilla' Javascript, SCSS, HTML5.</p>
            <p>SEO was important to the business, and so well defined copy, with properly written HTML mark-up, delivered via a traditional CMS based website was a great fit technically.</p>
            <p>To solve the navigational challenge, a pattern was used that enables a user to click on a menu item for larger screens, or use a native select for mobile devices in a simliar vein to a native mobile application.</p>
