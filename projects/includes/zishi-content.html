        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <p>In late 2019 / early 2020 we worked with Zishi Adaptive to realise an application for their HR Team. The project brief was to create a functional web based application that enabled HR professionals to visually assess candidate employment screenings.</p>
        <p>We agreed with the technical team at Zishi that Vue.Js would be an appropriate framework for this application, given the api / data driven requirements.</p>
        <p>We worked with the UX / UI / Back End consultants to deliver the working application to very tight timescales</p>

        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>As well as using HTML / SCSS, and ES6 Based Javascript, this project was a full Vue.JS build, utilising Vue Router, VueX for state, Node.js, Webpack, Axios, and lodash, as well as some other development dependencies.</p>

        <p>A working application ready for production use was delivered on schedule to the team at Zishi, along with a well structured codebase, and a testable application.</p>
