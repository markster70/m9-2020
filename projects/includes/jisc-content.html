        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <p>In 2019, we completed a concentrated piece of work for Jisc ( www.jisc.ac.uk )</p>
        <p>The brief was to join an existing development team, and refine their Front End Development / Design effort for Jisc Collections, a website being re-built for their organisation.</p>
        <p>We were given a 5 week deadline to produce the design work, implement any designs in code, and get the UI presentation layer of the whole site production ready.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="mn-projects-summary-detail-content">
        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>We created a number of fresh designs for the User Account sections of the website, as well as re-engineering many aspects of the Front End Code to improve structure, semantics, and accessibility.</p>
        <p>We also revised the structure of the build process in Node / Webpack in order to allow for better framework use in the future.</p>
        <p>Both SCSS, and HTML code standards were significantly improved, allowing the internal developers to further progress the project </p>
