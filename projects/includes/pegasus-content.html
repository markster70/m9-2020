        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <p>In May and June 2020 we worked with Pegasus Public Relations who are a Brighton based Marketing and Design agency for some of the world’s significant pharmaceutical industries.</p>
        <p>The brief was to create a single page website that was responsive with bespoke scrolling, and SVG based animated behaviour. The content was for a major health brand’s 2020 business report.</p>
        <p>A UI design was provided by the agency to us, setting out the vision for presentation that needed to be translated into a reality for both small and large screens.</p>
        <p>We were asked to use GSAP3 for the scrolling / animating behaviour, which we did, along with HTML5, SCSS, ES6 based JavaScript, as well as Gulp / Webpack, Babel, and Node for the build processes.

        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>We delivered a well performing, slick, animated site for Pegasus, meting the technical and aesthetic requirements of the project as per the brief. Our code was reviewed and approved by the internal technical  team, with the designs, and content also being signed off by the appropriate stakeholders within the business.</p>
        <p>We are very pleased to have worked with Pegasus on this interesting and innovative way of delivering an Annual report for one of their significant clients!</p>
