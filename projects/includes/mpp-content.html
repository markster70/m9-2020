        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <p>This piece of work is a Freelance piece for my other business - Mark Price Photography. I wanted a great
            looking, image led, e-commerce capable platform to be able to highlight, and sell my photography work.</p>

        <p>A bespoke theme for Wordpress was the right solution for me in this instance, leveraging the power of the
            popular platform, while creating a completely individual theme from scratch. This allowed me to control the
            UI design, and the code architecture 100%, without relying on a mass of plugins and 3rd party themes where
            performance, semantics, SEO, UI and accessibility can be poor.</p>
