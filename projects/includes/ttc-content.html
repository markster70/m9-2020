        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <p>In late 2018, we worked with The Travel Corporation, a multi-national group of travel and leisure companies.</p>
        <p>The project brief was two-fold - create a search application for an upcoming travel website, and retro-fit responsive design into that same website architecture ( designs were desktop first for initial build ).</p>

        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>Using Vue.js, a bespoke search application was created that was able to be dropped into the existing website development effort.</p>
        <p>A fast, restful based, reactive customer search facility was introduced, built to the customer's specification, and time deadlines.</p>
        <p>The large screen based code architecture was also re-arranged to complete the responsive requirements of the project so that the website was legible and presentable regardless of the type of device accessing it.</p>
        <p>Accessibility across the whole website was enhanced with improvements to HTML structure, and JavaScript Development</p>
