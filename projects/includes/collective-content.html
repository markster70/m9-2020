        <h3>Objectives</h3>
       <p>In August 2019, we worked with Collective London to produce a microsite for Hyundai's new sports range - the N series of cars.<p>
        <p>The objectives set were to create both a 'desktop' and 'mobile' version of a brochure type website for Hyundai, using the UI requirements created by the talented UI team at Collective</p>
        <p>The code needed to follow the clear conventions set by the technical team at Collective, while the look and feel had to match the UI designs 100%</p>

    <div class="mn-projects-summary-detail-content">
        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>We delivered a working model of both aspects of the site with Collective, and worked with the CMS team to integrate the code into the  Hyundai Production Environment</p>
        <p>We also re-engineered the build tooling for the whole Hyundai Project, integrating a modular gulp build to enhance the technical framework for other developers in the future.</p>
