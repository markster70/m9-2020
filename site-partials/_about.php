                        <p class="mn-body-copy">We're a small business, and we like it that way - we're able to focus on a small number of clients at once, meaning we can give you a personal, customised service, and really deliver what your business needs.</p>
                        <p class="mn-body-copy">Weâ€™ve been making websites for satisfied customers for around 12 years now. In that time we have worked with both local business clients, as well as major corporate companies.</p>
                        <p class="mn-body-copy">Our experience is a key strength. We use the latest technologies in the website development arena to create functional, good looking websites that will work on all types of devices.</p>

                        <p class="mn-body-copy">We love to listen carefully to your needs as a business, and use our specialist skills to deliver what will work best for you. The web development industry changes fast, and therefore we're always learning new techniques to help us deliver current, appropriate work.</p>
